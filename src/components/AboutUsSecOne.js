            PICON is Established in 2016 in Lahore, and having office in lahore,
            PICON has become the prestigious, trustworthy and pioneer
            Immigration Consultants in Pakistan. Our specialized services with
            expert counseling done by our fully trained Immigration consultants
            make us outstanding among others. We achieved our success because of
            how successfully we integrate with our clients. One complaint many
            people have about consultants is that they can be disruptive.
            Employees fear outside consultants coming in and destroying the
            workflow. Our clients face no such issues. We are a dedicated
            education consultancy committed to guiding students through every
            stage of their journey abroadâ€”from selecting the right university to
            settling in a new country.
